/**
 * Class GoFish
 * 
 * Description
 * 
 * REQUIREMENTS:
 * 1. Create two "hands", a Computer player and a Human player (Hint: ArrayLists)
 * 2. Each player starts with 7 cards randomly drawn from the deck
 * 3. Create a loop that runs while each player still has cards in their hands
 * 4. Create a state machine within the loop with a 'Human turn' state and a 'Computer turn' state
 * 5. Once the loop ends, calculate/print the score, and exit.
 * 
 * Remember, each turn consists of:
 * 1. Asking the other player for a face value (Current player must have that card in their hand)
 *      If the other player has any number of that card, hand them all over and repeat the turn
 *      else, draw one card and continue to the next turn
 * 2. At the end of each turn, remove books of 4, and add 1 point per book to their score.
 * 3. If the hand is empty at the end of a turn, draw 1 card from the deck
 * 
 * The Computer should ask for a random card in their deck. Use Math.random() for a random number generator.
 * For reference, try using the offical Javadoc search bar https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/
